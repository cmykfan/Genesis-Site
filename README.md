Genesis Website project for Code Louisville
This is my Code Louisville project. It's nothing special, but I've learned a lot in this short amount of time.
It is a basic website in which I go through a bit of the history of the music group Genesis.  There is a JavaScript functionality if you are on the Peter Gabriel Era page and click on the text “Peter Gabriel Era: 1967-1975” it will bring up a popup window box to give you more detail about this era.  I didn’t have time to get the Genesis Quiz up and running yet and there are also many dead links at this point since the site is still under construction, but they point you to the working links.
Thanks for taking a look.  I look forward to building on my knowledge and adding more to this site, along with loading other projects to GitHub in the future.
